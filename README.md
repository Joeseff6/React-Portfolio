## Project Description 

This project is simply my professional portfolio, which is built using React. This is a comparison to my previous portfolio project, where I used Bootstrap to achieve a responsive web page. This page is an actual application, as it has button functionality to add a little magic to my portfolio!

I used function components to build this portfolio, which was helpful in terms of re-using interactions throughout the application. This was a lot of work to start up, but once my components where made, I was able to freely use them all over my portfolio! A couple components I made include a navigation bar and footer, a header, containers for my projects and images (separately), and a list. My projects and lists toggle display by button-click, which was easily achievable using React hooks.
