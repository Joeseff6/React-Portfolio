## Project Description 

The purpose of this project is to build a React web-application that is interactive and dynamic. The difference between this project and others that don't use React is strictly in the code; a user won't see the differences between a React app and others built with traditional Javascript and DOM manipulation. However, React.js makes building truly interactive front end applications cheaper (memory-wise) and more convenient when re-using common components, like buttons, tables, lists, and more!

## What to Expect From the Application

Employee Reactory is an application that is mainly used for demonstrating how powerful React.js can be in regards to UI. Random user information is obtained by calling the Random User Generator (randomuser.me/api) and is displayed in a table. Since the API returns random information per request, new users will be displayed upon refresh. One of the capabilities of React is the ability to change component states, which in turn re-renders the component to display the new state (or perform other functions). This is demonstrated through the search bar function, which will dynamically return users that match the search criteria as they type.

## Tech Stack

* Front-end: CSS3/HTML5
* Front-end/back-end logic: Javascript
* User-Interface: React.js
## Goals for Deployment

- [x] When the user visits the application, they will be presented with random user data
- [x] When the user types in the search bar, the page will dynamically change to return the users matching the criteria
- [] The user can click on a column header to sort the data by that column
